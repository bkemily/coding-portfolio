# Argie’s Adventure

## Description
The turn-based tactical RPG "Argie’s Adventure" invites players to embark on a journey progressing through several levels. Engaging in strategic warfare, players find themselves locked in combat against single or multiple enemies before progressing to the next stage. Each character, player or enemy, has a position in the turn order during each battle round, with possibilities for different moves, whether to attack, cast magic, or use potions. 

As the player advances through the game, the challenge escalates with the introduction of new enemies. The player's character also grows, potentially gaining new skills and improving their stats.

## How to install
### Downloading the Source Code:

To execute the program you first need to download the source code. The source can be saved in whichever directory you like.
You can do this by either clicking the green "Code" button on github and selecting "Download ZIP" or by using `git clone` in your terminal


## Executing the program
### Via Eclipse:

First open eclipse, then in the toolbar go to
`File->Import...->General->Project from Folder or Archive`.
From there click the "Directory..." button, open the folder containing the source code, then click the "Finish" button.

You should end up with a folder called "cen3031-fall23-semester-project-cen3031fall23-group-4"

## How to Interact:

All screens that user will encounter accommodate user input using buttons positioned at the bottom. These buttons support both mouse clicks and keyboard control (utilizing the tab key for cycling through options and the enter key for button selection). It is noteworthy that the screens have some level of adaptability in terms of scaling.
